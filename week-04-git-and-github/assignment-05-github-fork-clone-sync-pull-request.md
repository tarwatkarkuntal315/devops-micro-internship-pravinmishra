# Assignment 5 — Open-Source Collaboration: Fork, Clone, Sync & Pull Request

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will contribute one small documentation change to a shared repository using a standard open-source collaboration workflow: fork, clone, configure remotes, branch, commit, sync with upstream, push, and open a Pull Request. This is a different, separate practice repository from the one you submit your DMI work in.

# Task 0 — Fork the Upstream Repository

## Goal

Fork `pravinmishraaws/devops-micro-internship-interviews` into your own GitHub account.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Your fork page with your username and `devops-micro-internship-interviews` visible in the browser URL

---

# Task 1 — Authenticate GitHub from the Terminal

## Goal

Configure one authentication method — HTTPS with a Personal Access Token, or SSH — so you can push to your fork. Use only one method.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `git config --global --get credential.helper` (HTTPS) or `ssh -T git@github.com` (SSH) showing successful authentication — never show your token or private key

---

# Task 2 — Clone Your Fork and Configure Remotes

## Goal

Clone your fork locally, then add the original repository as `upstream`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `git remote -v` showing `origin` pointing to your fork and `upstream` pointing to `pravinmishraaws/devops-micro-internship-interviews`

# Task 3 — Create a Feature Branch and Make Your Change

## Goal

Create the branch `feature-readme-update`, add only your own entry (`Full Name — Group <Group Name/Number>`) to the Student List at the end of `pull_request.md`, and commit it with the message `docs: add my name to student list`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Output of `git status` showing `pull_request.md` modified before staging

# Task 4 — Synchronize with Upstream and Push to Your Fork

## Goal

Fetch and merge `upstream/main` into your local default branch, rebase your feature branch onto it, then push `feature-readme-update` to your fork.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Output of `git push -u origin feature-readme-update` showing a successful push

![Screenshot 6 — Successful feature branch push](screenshots/assignment-05/week-04-assignment-05-screenshot-06-feature-branch-push.png)

#### Screenshot 7 — Your fork on GitHub showing `feature-readme-update` in the branch selector or a "Compare & pull request" banner

---

# Task 5 — Create a Pull Request to Upstream

## Goal

Open a Pull Request from `feature-readme-update` on your fork to `main` on the upstream repository, using the title `docs: add my name to student list`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Pull Request creation page showing the correct base repository, base branch, head repository, compare branch, and title
