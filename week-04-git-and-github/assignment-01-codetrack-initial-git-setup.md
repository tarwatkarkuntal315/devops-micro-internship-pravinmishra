# Assignment 1 — CodeTrack: Initial Git Setup (Local Only)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will set up Git correctly on your local machine before starting the CodeTrack project. You will create a local repository and configure your Git identity at both the repository level (local) and the machine level (global). This assignment is local only — you will not push anything to GitHub yet.

---

# Task 1 — Create the CodeTrack Project and Initialize Git

## Goal

Create a `CodeTrack` project folder and initialize it as a Git repository.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `git init` inside `CodeTrack` showing "Initialized empty Git repository"

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `ls -a` showing the `.git` folder

### Notes

**1. What is the `.git` folder, and why does it matter?**

The `.git` folder stores the Git repository information, including its history and configuration. It is created when we run `git init`. It matters because Git uses this folder to track changes and manage commits, branches, and other version control operations.

# Task 2 — Configure Git Identity Locally (Repository-Only)

## Goal

Set your Git username and email for the `CodeTrack` repository only, using `git config --local`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `git config --local --list` showing your `user.name` and `user.email`

![Screenshot 3 - Local Git configuration](screenshots/assignment-01/week-04-assignment-01-screenshot-03-local-config.png)

The local Git identity configured for the CodeTrack repository is:

- **user.name:** Kuntal Tarwatkar
- **user.email:** tarwatkarkuntal315@gmail.com

# Task 3 — Configure Git Identity Globally

## Goal

Set a global Git username and email for this machine using `git config --global`. Note that CodeTrack's local settings still take priority over these.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Output of `git config --global --list` showing your `user.name` and `user.email`

![Screenshot 4 - Global Git configuration](screenshots/assignment-01/week-04-assignment-01-screenshot-04-global-config.png)

The global Git identity configured on the machine is:

- **user.name:** Kuntal Tarwatkar
- **user.email:** tarwatkarkuntal315@gmail.com

The local configuration inside CodeTrack can override the global configuration when both are present.

# Task 4 — Share Your Git Setup Progress

The Git setup progress was shared on WhatsApp Status using the DMI-generated progress message and link.
