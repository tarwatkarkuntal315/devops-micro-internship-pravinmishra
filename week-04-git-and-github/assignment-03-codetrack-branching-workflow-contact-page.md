# Task 2 — Create and Switch to a Feature Branch

## Goal

Create a branch named exactly `feature/contact-page` and switch to it.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `git checkout -b feature/contact-page` and `git branch` showing `* feature/contact-page`

#### Screenshot 4 — Output of `git commit`

Add your screenshot here.
