# Assignment 2 — Deploy a React App on an Azure VM (Ubuntu + Nginx)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will provision a secure Ubuntu virtual machine in Microsoft Azure, build the `my-react-app` React application, and serve the production static build through Nginx. You will validate the deployment from the VM's public IP.

---

# Task 1 — Create a Resource Group

## Goal

Create the Azure Resource Group `react-app-rg` in a region close to you.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Resource Group overview showing the name and region

---

# Task 2 — Provision Ubuntu VM (20.04) with Correct Networking

## Goal

Create an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS VM (size B1s) with a Network Security Group allowing SSH (22, restricted to your IP where possible) and HTTP (80).

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Azure VM overview page showing the VM name, Resource Group, and region

#### Screenshot 3 — Network Security Group inbound rules showing ports 22 and 80 allowed

---

# Task 3 — SSH into the Azure VM

## Goal

Connect to the VM over SSH and confirm the Linux prompt is visible.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Terminal showing a successful SSH login with the prompt visible

---

# Task 4 — Update OS and Install Prerequisites (Git, Node.js, npm)

## Goal

Update Ubuntu and install Git, Node.js, and npm.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Terminal output showing `node -v` and `npm -v`

![Screenshot 5 - Node.js and npm Versions](screenshots/assignment-02/week-07-assignment-02-screenshot-05-node-npm-versions.png)

Verified versions:
- Node.js: `v22.23.3`
- npm: `10.9.9`
- Git: `2.25.1`

---

# Task 5 — Clone and Build the React App

## Goal

Clone `my-react-app`, install dependencies, and run `npm run build` to produce the `build/` directory.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Terminal showing successful `npm run build` completion and `ls -la build` output

---

# Task 6 — Install and Configure Nginx to Serve the React Build

## Goal

Install Nginx and configure it to serve the `build/` directory with `try_files $uri /index.html;` for SPA routing support.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Successful `sudo nginx -t` output

![Screenshot 7 - Nginx Test](screenshots/assignment-02/week-07-assignment-02-screenshot-07-nginx-test.png)

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Nginx configuration snippet showing the build root and `try_files` directive

---

# Task 7 — Test the Deployment (Public IP)

## Goal

Confirm the React app loads through the VM's public IP, navigation works, and a nested route still works after a page refresh.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Browser showing the React app with the public IP visible in the address bar

![Screenshot 9 - Live React App](screenshots/assignment-02/week-07-assignment-02-screenshot-09-live-react-app.png)

The application was successfully loaded through the VM public IP:

`http://20.244.106.15`

The project does not include an additional React Router dependency, so there was no separate nested client-side route to demonstrate. The root application was verified successfully through the public IP.

---

# Task 8 — Basic Hardening (Recommended)

## Goal

Restrict the SSH Network Security Group rule to your IP if not already restricted, and confirm the firewall does not block port 80.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 (optional) — Network Security Group rule showing SSH restricted to your IP
