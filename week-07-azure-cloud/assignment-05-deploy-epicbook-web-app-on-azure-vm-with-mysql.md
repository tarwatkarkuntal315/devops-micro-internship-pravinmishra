# Assignment 5 — Deploy EpicBook Web App on Azure VM with Azure Database for MySQL

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will deploy the EpicBook web application on Azure using an Ubuntu Virtual Machine to host the frontend and backend, and Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server (private access) to store user and product data. You will build the network, provision the resources, deploy the application, and prove that the complete user flow works through the VM's public IP.

# Task 1 — Create Network Infrastructure

## Goal

Create a VNet (10.0.0.0/16) with a public subnet (10.0.1.0/24) for the VM and a private subnet (10.0.2.0/24) for MySQL, with NSGs allowing HTTP (80)/SSH (22) publicly and MySQL (3306) only from the VM subnet, plus a Public IP and Network Interface for the VM.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Virtual Network overview showing the 10.0.0.0/16 address space and both subnets

# Task 2 — Provision Azure Virtual Machine

## Goal

Launch an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VM (Standard B1s or equivalent) in the public subnet, and install Node.js, npm, Nginx, Git, and MySQL Client.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Virtual Machine overview showing Ubuntu, size, public IP, and subnet

# Task 3 — Deploy the EpicBook Application

## Goal

Clone the EpicBook repository, install dependencies, build the frontend, configure Nginx to serve it, and configure the Node.js/Express.js backend to connect to MySQL using environment variables.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Terminal showing the EpicBook repository cloned and dependencies installed

# Task 4 — Setup Azure Database for MySQL

## Goal

Create a private Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server (VNet Integration) in the private subnet, create the database user and schema, import the SQL dump, and restrict access to the VM subnet only.

### Evidence

# Task 5 — Test End-to-End Functionality

## Goal

Confirm the EpicBook application loads through the VM's public IP and that viewing products, adding items to the cart, and placing orders all work.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 12 — Browser showing the EpicBook application with the Virtual Machine public IP visible
