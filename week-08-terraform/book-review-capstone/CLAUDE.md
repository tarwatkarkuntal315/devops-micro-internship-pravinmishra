-# Book Review Terraform Capstone — Claude Code Project Instructions

## Role
Act as an AI DevOps engineering assistant for the Book Review App Terraform capstone. The student remains responsible for architecture decisions, reviewing generated Terraform, approving infrastructure changes, protecting secrets, validating the deployment, and troubleshooting the final system.

Do not treat AI-generated infrastructure as automatically correct.

## Application
Repository: https://github.com/pravinmishraaws/book-review-app

- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: Node.js / Express
- Database: MySQL

Before creating deployment automation, inspect the repository and its package files. Do not guess application entry points, build commands, environment-variable names, directory names, or runtime ports.

## Required Architecture
Build a production-style three-tier architecture using Terraform on the cloud selected by the student.

Network:
- Custom network CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
- Two public Web Tier subnets
- Two private Application Tier subnets
- Two private Database Tier subnets
- Spread across two availability locations where supported

Example AWS subnet plan:
- Web A: 10.0.1.0/24
- Web B: 10.0.2.0/24
- App A: 10.0.11.0/24
- App B: 10.0.12.0/24
- DB A: 10.0.21.0/24
- DB B: 10.0.22.0/24

Traffic flow:
Internet -> Public Load Balancer -> Web Tier -> Internal Load Balancer -> Application Tier -> Managed MySQL

Backend:
- Runs on port 3001
- Must not be publicly accessible

Database:
- MySQL port 3306
- Must not be publicly accessible
- Must accept MySQL traffic only from the Application Tier
- Use private networking
- Configure high availability / Multi-AZ equivalent
- Configure a read replica where required

## Project Decisions (Kuntal Tarwatkar — AWS)
- Cloud: AWS, region `ap-south-1`, AZs `ap-south-1a` and `ap-south-1b`
- Terraform code lives in `terraform/` (root module) with modules under `terraform/modules/`
- Public load balancer: internet-facing ALB in the two Web subnets, HTTP 80 -> Web Tier
- Internal load balancer: internal ALB in the two App subnets, forwards to backend port 3001
- Web Tier: one EC2 per Web subnet running Next.js (`npm run build` + `npm start`, port 3000) behind Nginx on port 80
- Application Tier: one EC2 per App subnet, no public IP, Express backend `backend/src/server.js` on port 3001
- Database: Amazon RDS for MySQL, Multi-AZ, plus one read replica, in the two DB subnets, `publicly_accessible = false`
- Outbound: one NAT Gateway for the App subnets (cost-conscious lab choice; document it as a single point of failure). DB subnets get no internet route.
- Admin access: SSH only to Web instances from the student's IP; App instances reached via the Web instances or SSM — never directly from the internet.

### Frontend-to-backend path (from repository inspection)
The frontend calls the API from the **browser** using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (baked in at build time, see `frontend/src/services/api.js`). A browser cannot reach an internal ALB, so:
- Build the frontend with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://<public ALB DNS>/api` — the `/api` suffix is required: `api.js` calls `${API_URL}/users/login`, `${API_URL}/books`, etc., while Express mounts routes at `/api/users`, `/api/books`, `/api/reviews` (the "does NOT contain /api" comment in `api.js` is wrong)
- Nginx on the Web Tier proxies `/api/` to the internal ALB **keeping the `/api` prefix** (`proxy_pass http://<internal ALB DNS>;` with no URI part), and everything else to Next.js on 3000
- Resulting path: Browser -> Public ALB -> Web Nginx -> /api -> Internal ALB -> Backend 3001 -> RDS

### Backend environment variables (from `backend/src`)
`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_DIALECT`, `PORT`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
- `PORT` must be set to 3001 (code default is 5000).
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` must include `http://<public ALB DNS>` or the CORS middleware rejects browser POSTs (login/register/review).
- `db.js` always connects with SSL (`rejectUnauthorized: false`); RDS MySQL accepts this. `DB_NAME` must already exist (set `db_name` on the RDS instance). On start the backend runs `sync({ alter: true })` and seeds sample data if tables are empty.
- The repo commits `backend/node_modules`; run `npm ci`/`npm install` on the instance anyway (Linux binaries).
Never hard-code `DB_PASS` or `JWT_SECRET` in Terraform, user data, or committed files; pass them as sensitive variables at deploy time.

### Cost control
NAT Gateway, two ALBs, RDS Multi-AZ, and the read replica bill by the hour. Apply only when ready to test, and remind the student to `terraform destroy` (human-run) after evidence is captured.

## Terraform Engineering Rules
- Use modular Terraform.
- Prefer logical modules such as network, security, load-balancer, compute, and database.
- Use variables for configurable values.
- Use outputs only for values that genuinely need to be exposed.
- Pass dependencies between modules using module inputs and outputs.
- Use consistent naming and tags where supported.
- Do not hard-code cloud credentials.
- Do not output passwords, private keys, tokens, or other secrets.
- Do not commit Terraform state files.
- Do not assume provider arguments from memory when current documentation can be consulted.
- Use the Terraform MCP server for current Terraform Registry/provider/module information when relevant.
- Explain important architecture or security decisions before making significant changes.

## Required Engineering Sequence
Work incrementally. Do not generate the entire project in one uncontrolled step.

1. Networking
2. Security
3. Load Balancing
4. Database
5. Compute
6. Application Deployment
7. Verification and Troubleshooting

## Validation Workflow
Before deployment:
1. terraform fmt
2. terraform validate
3. terraform plan
4. Review for unexpected public IPs, 0.0.0.0/0 rules, public DB exposure, incorrect 3001/3306 exposure, deletions/replacements, missing resources, and obvious cost risks.
5. Request architecture/security review where appropriate.
6. Require human approval before terraform apply.

## Safety Rules
- Never automatically approve terraform apply.
- Never automatically execute terraform destroy.
- Never weaken network security merely to make the application work.
- Never expose credentials or secrets in output, screenshots, logs, Terraform outputs, or committed files.
- Never copy private SSH keys into source control.
- Prefer diagnosing root cause before changing infrastructure.
- Make one controlled change at a time and retest.
- If a Terraform resource or argument is uncertain, consult current documentation rather than guessing.

## Troubleshooting Method
When a deployment fails:
1. Observe the failure.
2. Collect evidence.
3. Identify the likely failing layer.
4. Propose diagnostic checks in order.
5. Verify the root cause.
6. Make one controlled fix.
7. Retest.

Useful evidence includes Terraform errors/plans, route tables, security rules, target health, curl results, Nginx logs, application logs, PM2 logs, DNS results, and DB connection errors.

## Subagents
Use `terraform-engineer` for Terraform implementation, documentation-backed Terraform decisions, module creation, validation, and plan analysis.

Use `architecture-security-reviewer` after major phases and before deployment to independently review architecture, networking, security, availability, secrets, and Terraform quality.

Reviewer findings must be evaluated before changes are made.
