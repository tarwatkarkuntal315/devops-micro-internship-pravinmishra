# Assignment 3 — Deploy a React Application on Azure Using Terraform

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Terraform to provision the required Azure infrastructure and automatically deploy the `my-react-app` React application on an Azure Linux virtual machine using a `cloud-init.sh` deployment script passed to the VM through `custom_data`.

You will verify the automated deployment through SSH, confirm that Nginx is running, access the React application through the VM public IP, and destroy the Terraform-managed resources after testing.

---

# Task 0 — Set Up and Verify the Terraform and Azure CLI Environment

## Goal

Prepare your local environment for Terraform deployment by installing Terraform, Azure CLI, and the HashiCorp Terraform extension in VS Code, signing in to your Azure account, and confirming that all required tools are working correctly.

## Evidence

# Task 1 — Create a New Terraform Project and Define the Infrastructure

## Goal

Create a new Terraform project and define the complete Azure infrastructure required to host the React application using the official Terraform Registry documentation.

The `terraform-react-azure` project must contain:

```text
terraform-react-azure/
├── main.tf
└── cloud-init.sh
```

The Terraform configuration must include:

- Terraform and AzureRM provider configuration
- Resource group
- Virtual network and subnet
- Network Security Group
- SSH rule for TCP port `22`
- HTTP rule for TCP port `80`
- Public IP address
- Network interface
- Linux virtual machine
- `custom_data` configuration referencing `cloud-init.sh`
- Public IP output

The `cloud-init.sh` file must contain the complete automated React application deployment workflow based on the repository instructions.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 4 — Provider, Resource Group, and Network Security Group

Add a screenshot of VS Code showing the AzureRM provider, resource group, and Network Security Group configuration in `main.tf`.
