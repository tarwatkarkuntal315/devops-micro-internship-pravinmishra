# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

The cost-optimizer uses Haiku because its task is relatively simple. It mainly checks Terraform settings like price class, storage class, and lifecycle rules. Haiku is fast and less expensive, so it is suitable for this type of task.

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

The security-auditor does not have Write access because its job is only to check the Terraform files and find security issues. It should not make any changes to the files. This also makes the agent safer because it only has the permissions it needs.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

The tf-writer uses inherit because it allows the agent to use the same model as the main Claude Code session. This is useful because Terraform tasks can be different in complexity, so the agent is not limited to one fixed model.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — The delegation message showing Claude launched the security-auditor

#### Screenshot 5 — Security audit report output

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — The full cost optimization report
