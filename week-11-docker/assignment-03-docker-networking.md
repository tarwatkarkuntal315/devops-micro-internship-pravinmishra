# Assignment 3 — Docker Networking

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will explore Docker networking by using default bridge, custom bridge, multiple bridge, and host network modes. You will verify container communication, service discovery, network isolation, public access, and host networking on a Linux VM or EC2 instance.

---

# Task 1 — Deploy a Standalone Application Using the Default Bridge Network

## Goal

Deploy an Nginx web server using Docker’s default bridge network and access it through the VM public IP address.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Available Docker Networks

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network ls
```

The output must include the default `bridge`, `host`, and `none` networks.

#### Screenshot 2 — Nginx Image Pull

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of:

```bash
docker pull nginx:alpine
```

#### Screenshot 3 — Running `myweb` Container

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the running `myweb` container with:

```text
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```

```bash
docker network ls
```

![Screenshot 5](screenshots/assignment-03/week-11-assignment-03-screenshot-05-mynetwork.png)

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show both `web` and `client` containers running without published host ports.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Service Discovery by Container Name

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful output from:

# Task 3 — Demonstrate Multi-Network Isolation

## Goal

Deploy frontend, backend, and database containers across two separate Docker networks. Verify allowed communication and confirm that the frontend cannot directly reach the database.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Two Docker Networks

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network ls
```

The output must include both `frontend-network` and `backend-network`.

![Screenshot 9](screenshots/assignment-03/week-11-assignment-03-screenshot-09-network-ls-two-networks.png)

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Running Multi-Network Containers

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show:

- `frontend` with the published port mapping `0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp`
- `backend` without a published host port
- `db` without a published host port

![Screenshot 10](screenshots/assignment-03/week-11-assignment-03-screenshot-10-three-containers-docker-ps.png)

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Frontend Network Inspection

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network inspect frontend-network
```

The output must show `frontend` and `backend`.

![Screenshot 11](screenshots/assignment-03/week-11-assignment-03-screenshot-11-frontend-network-inspect.png)

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Backend Network Inspection

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network inspect backend-network
```

The output must show `backend` and `db`.

![Screenshot 12](screenshots/assignment-03/week-11-assignment-03-screenshot-12-backend-network-inspect.png)

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Frontend-to-Backend Communication

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful output from:

```bash
docker exec frontend wget -qO- http://backend
```

The output must display the Nginx Welcome Page HTML.

![Screenshot 13](screenshots/assignment-03/week-11-assignment-03-screenshot-13-frontend-to-backend.png)
